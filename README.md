# An example Play + Docker app

This project exists at: <https://github.com/oleksandra-holovina/docker-play-example>

*Huge thanks to
[Lexie](https://www.linkedin.com/in/oleksandra-holovina-287740b0/) for putting
that project together! It wouldn't exist without her help and expertise.*

I added this repo to make it easier to find in case you search for [Docker
examples](https://github.com/nickjj?tab=repositories&q=docker-*-example) under
my account.
